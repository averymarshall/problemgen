## Introduction 

Problemgen is a developing Python API designed to provide an intuitive interface for generating math worksheets. While this can be accomplished in any word processing program or with knowledge of common typesetting languages like LaTeX or Markdown, it can be time consuming to create the questions and format them. This package seeks to streamline this process by automatically generating problems and solutions and formatting them.It also seeks to provide as many customization options as possible to the user. Ultimately, it may be useful as a backend for a GUI or web-based application.
